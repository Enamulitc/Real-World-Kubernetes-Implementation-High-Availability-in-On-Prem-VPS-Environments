Real-World Kubernetes Implementation: High Availability in On-Prem &amp; VPS Environments
A practical guide to setting up production-grade Kubernetes clusters, with tooling and architectural decisions based on real-world experience.

🧭 Introduction
This post walks through real-world Kubernetes setups both on-premises and in VPS environments, focusing on:

High availability

Storage

Load balancing

Disaster recovery

Monitoring

Tools like kubeadm, Kubespray, Rancher, K3s, KubeVirt, Knative, Velero, KEDA, and more.

📦 Tools & Methods for Cluster Setup
Tool	Description	Best Use
kubeadm	Vanilla K8s installer	Full control, HA with manual setup
Kubespray	Ansible-based multi-node deployment	Automated HA setup
Rancher	UI-driven multi-cluster management	Ease of use & enterprise-friendly
K3s	Lightweight Kubernetes	Ideal for VPS or edge
RKE2	Hardened K3s version	Production-grade light clusters

🏢 On-Premises Kubernetes Architecture (Production-Grade)
1. Load Balancing & External Access
Standard Approach:

Hardware Load Balancer (F5, NetScaler, Kemp) → MetalLB (BGP mode) → Ingress → Services

Alternative:

MetalLB + ExternalDNS + reserved static IPs

2. Storage
Enterprise-Grade CSI Drivers:

NetApp Trident

Dell EMC CSI

Pure Storage CSI

Alternative Software-Defined Storage:

Rook-Ceph

Longhorn

3. Networking
Recommended CNIs:

Calico with BGP for L3 integration

Integration with SDN (Cisco ACI, NSX-T)

🌐 VPS-Based Kubernetes Architecture (Production-Grade)
1. External Access
Practical Setup:


[Public IP:80/443]
      ↓
[Nginx Reverse Proxy on VPS Host]
      ↓
[NodePort Services (e.g., 30080)]
Example Nginx Config:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name app.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:30080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
2. Multi-Node Network
Use WireGuard if private networking isn't available:

[Interface]
PrivateKey = <private-key>
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = <peer-key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
Endpoint = <peer-public-ip>:51820
3. Storage
Simple: NFS Provisioner

Resilient: Longhorn

💾 Best Production-Grade Storage Solutions
1. 🔁 Longhorn (All-Around Best)

apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: longhorn
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
provisioner: driver.longhorn.io
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
  numberOfReplicas: "3"
  fsType: ext4
  
2. 🐘 Rook-Ceph (Enterprise-Scale)
   
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: rook-ceph-block
provisioner: rook-ceph.rbd.csi.ceph.com
parameters:
  pool: replicapool
  clusterID: rook-ceph
  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: ext4
allowVolumeExpansion: true
reclaimPolicy: Delete

4. 🧱 OpenEBS (Flexible)
Jiva, cStor, LocalPV support

Easy to configure

Great for VPS/edge nodes

🔒 Certificate Management
Let's Encrypt + cert-manager

Enterprise PKI for on-prem

📈 Monitoring & Logging
Need	Tool
Metrics	Prometheus, Grafana
Logs	Loki, EFK (Elasticsearch + Fluentd + Kibana)

🧩 Backup & Disaster Recovery
Type	Tool
Cluster/app backups	Velero
etcd snapshots	Scheduled cronjobs off-cluster

⚙️ Kubernetes High Availability Practices
Environment	Strategy
On-Prem	3+ control plane nodes, external etcd, spread across physical hardware
VPS	Use different provider regions, WireGuard mesh, control plane node anti-affinity

🚀 Advanced Components in Production
Component	Purpose
Knative	Serverless deployments
KEDA	Event-driven autoscaling
KubeVirt	Run VMs inside Kubernetes
Node Problem Detector	Monitor & report node issues
HPA	Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
CRDs	Extend K8s APIs
cert-manager	Automatic TLS certificate lifecycle

✅ Final Thoughts
In real-world scenarios, success comes from aligning tools and configurations to the environment's constraints, not from chasing ideal architectures. Kubernetes gives you flexibility—your job is to balance simplicity, resilience, and maintainability.
